## Overview

Webhooks allow your system to **receive real-time notifications** when audio extraction jobs complete or fail.  
Instead of polling the status endpoint repeatedly, you can have the API push updates to your server.

> ⚡ Recommended for production workloads

## Configuring Webhooks

You can provide a **webhook URL** in the `options` object when creating a job:

```json
{
  "source": { "type": "url", "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4" },
  "output": { "format": "mp3" },
  "options": {
    "webhook": "https://example.com/webhook"
  }
}
```

For **batch jobs**, the webhook URL applies to all jobs in the batch.

## Webhook Best Practices

* Validate incoming requests to ensure they originate from **Converso Empire** (use secret headers or tokens)
* Respond with **HTTP 200 OK** quickly to avoid retries
* Log events for auditing and debugging
* Use job IDs to correlate with internal systems
* Handle `job.failed` gracefully and trigger retries if necessary

---

## Example Webhook Integration (Node.js)

```javascript
app.post("/webhook", express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;

  if (payload.event === "job.completed") {
    console.log(`Job ${payload.jobId} completed`);
    console.log(`Download: ${payload.outputFile.url}`);
  } else if (payload.event === "job.failed") {
    console.error(`Job ${payload.jobId} failed: ${payload.error.message}`);
  }

  res.status(200).send("Received");
});
```

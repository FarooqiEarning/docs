  }
}
```

---

## Progress Recommendations

- Poll **every 2–5 seconds** while job is processing
- Stop polling once status is `completed` or `failed`
- For production, **use webhooks** to avoid unnecessary API calls

---

## Best Practices

- Always handle `failed` jobs gracefully
- Check `progress` and `currentStep` for UI updates
- Use the `statusUrl` returned from `POST /v1/extract` for consistency
- Combine with **Download Audio endpoint** once `status = completed`

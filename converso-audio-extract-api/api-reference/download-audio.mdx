    "message": "The extraction job is not yet completed. Try again later."
  }
}
```

---

```json

    "message": "The extracted audio file has expired and is no longer available."
  }
}
```

---

## Example Response – Job Not Found

```json

## Best Practices

* Always check **status** before downloading; only completed jobs are available.
* Use the `statusUrl` from the job creation response to confirm completion.
* Consider **streaming** large files instead of downloading entirely in memory.
* Save files locally immediately; files are removed after 24 hours.
* Handle errors gracefully (`JOB_NOT_COMPLETED`, `FILE_EXPIRED`, `JOB_NOT_FOUND`).

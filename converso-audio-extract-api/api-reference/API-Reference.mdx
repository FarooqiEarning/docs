## Overview

This section provides the **complete technical reference** for the **Converso Audio Extraction API**.

Here you'll find:
- Endpoint definitions
- Request and response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error formats
- Webhook payload structures

If you're new, we recommend reading the **Introduction** and **Quickstart** first.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```text
https://api.conversoempire.world/audio-extract
```

---

## Authentication

All endpoints require an API key.

### Required Header

```http
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

## API Design Principles

The Converso Audio Extraction API follows consistent patterns:

* **Asynchronous job-based processing**
* **Predictable RESTful endpoints**
* **Consistent response envelopes**
* **Explicit error codes**
* **Stateless requests**

---

## Response Structure

Most endpoints return a standard response object.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Optional human-readable message"
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": "Optional additional information"
  }
}
```

## Job Lifecycle

Most API operations revolve around **jobs**.

### Job Status Values

| Status       | Description                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `queued`     | Job is waiting to be processed |
| `processing` | Job is actively running        |
| `completed`  | Job finished successfully      |
| `failed`     | Job failed with an error       |

### Processing Steps

* `downloading_video`
* `analyzing_video`
* `extracting_audio`
* `finalizing`

---

## File Retention Policy

* Extracted audio files are stored temporarily
* Default retention period: **24 hours**
* After expiration, downloads will return an error

---

## Rate Limits

Rate limits depend on your plan and subscription tier.

If you exceed your limits, you may receive:

* `429 Too Many Requests`
* `503 Service Unavailable`

> For production workloads, use **batch processing** and **webhooks** to reduce API calls.

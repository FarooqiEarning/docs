## Quickstart

This guide will help you make your **first successful API request** with Converso Empire in just a few minutes.

All Converso Empire services follow **consistent authentication, request patterns, and response structures**, so once you learn one API, the rest feel familiar.

---

## Step 1: Create an Account

To use Converso Empire APIs, you'll need an account on our platform or marketplace (such as RapidAPI).

<Card

>
  Sign up and subscribe to a Converso Empire API to get your API key.
</Card>

---

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

After subscribing, you'll receive an **API key**.  
This key is required for **all requests**.

⚠️ **Keep your API key secret** — do not expose it in frontend code or public repositories.

Example header:

```http
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

## Step 3: Make Your First Request

Below is a simple example request.
(The endpoint may vary depending on the API you're using.)

### Example using `curl`

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.conversoempire.com/v1/example \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Hello Converso Empire"
  }'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Request processed successfully"
  }
}
```
